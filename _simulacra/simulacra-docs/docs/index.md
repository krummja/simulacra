# Simulacra RPG

## Progression

How do I want players/characters to "progress" in the game? I want an open system for classes and such. I want the game itself to be fairly open-ended. This, I suppose, opens up the question of what the end _goal_ of the game is.

There are other games with similar overall aims to Simulacra. One notable example is *Caves of Qud*. That game aims to provide players with freedom of choice as they explore a vast world, learn deep lore, and possibly pursue a central narrative thread. CoQ emphasizes things like exploration and depth of simulation paired with hand-crafted story to make a rich background for the player to develop in.

I want Simulacra to have a similar sort of structure and aim.

    - Freedom of Choice
    - Lore
    - Exploration
    - Simulation
      - Environment interaction
      - Character interaction
    - Stories
    - Prefabricated and preocedural elements

## Characters

Characters in Simulacra will not be boxed into predefined classes. One option is to have players start out with a totally procedural character background; since real life doesn't give us choice, neither does the simulated world of Simulacra. This puts biases on the things you can pursue, but it will ensure a radically different playstyle every time.

If I take that option, I want to also give players the choice of entering a character creator. I don't want to take character personalization away from players, but I do want to emphasize that Simulacra is "meant to be experienced" a certain way.
